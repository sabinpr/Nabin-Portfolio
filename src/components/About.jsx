        I am Dr. Nabin Prajapati, a Nepali citizen with extensive experience in
        healthcare. I have worked in Nepal for 5 years, spent 1 year practicing
        medicine in the UK, and I am currently working in Australia. My journey
        across different healthcare systems has strengthened my skills and
        dedication to providing compassionate, patient-centered, and
        evidence-based medical care.
